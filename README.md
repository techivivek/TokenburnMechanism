# Token Burn Mechanism

## Description
Token Burn Mechanism is an ERC-20 based cryptocurrency that burns a percentage of tokens during each transaction. This mechanism helps reduce the total supply over time, creating a deflationary economic model.

## Smart Contract Address
```
[ Replace with deployed smart contract address ]
```

## Features
- ðŸ”¥ Burns a percentage of tokens on every transaction
- âœ… Decentralized and immutable
- âš¡ Fast and secure transactions

## How It Works
- When a user transfers tokens, a portion (e.g., **2%**) is permanently burned.
- The burned tokens are sent to a non-recoverable address, reducing total supply.
- This deflationary mechanism increases scarcity, potentially boosting token value.

## Why Implement a Burn Mechanism?
- **Deflationary Model**: Reduces supply over time, increasing token value.
- **Long-Term Holding Incentive**: Encourages users to hold rather than frequently transact.
- **Anti-Inflation**: Prevents oversupply, unlike fiat currencies.

## How to Use
1. **Deploy the Contract**: Use **Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry** to deploy on Ethereum or other EVM-compatible chains.
2. **Add Token to Wallet**: Users can add the token to **MetaMask or Trust Wallet** using the contract address.
3. **Transfer and Observe**: Every transfer will reduce both the receiverâ€™s balance and the total supply.
4. **Verify on Block Explorer**: Check burned transactions on **Etherscan, BscScan, or Polygonscan**.
